- If you hover over the account type, it's more specific (Migrated from Mojang, Newly Created (Microsoft), etc.)
- To enable the Hide BLC feature, you must press on the NameMC+ icon on the top right of your browser. If you can't find it, press on the extensions button in the top right and pin the NameMC+ extension. After that you must close out the menu and press on the NameMC+ icon, then a settings menu should open with a option to Hide BLC (Badlion Client).

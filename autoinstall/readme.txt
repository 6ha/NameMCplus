*MAKE SURE YOU HAVE GIT INSTALLED AND THAT YOU CAN USE GIT FROM CMD*

DO NOT RUN THE autoUpdate.bat IN THE NAMEMC+ FOLDER, RUN IT IN 1 FOLDER ABOVE.

If you want to move it, make a shortcut and move that shortcut while keeping the autoUpdate where it is.

I recommend making a folder called nmcPlus and putting the autoUpdate.bat in it, then just run it and it should install all the files.

As long as you have the files in the right place, running this file will always do a fresh install of the newest version.
